## About ULearn

**ULearn** by Campus Connect is an innovative educational web application designed to provide university students with personalized and high-quality tutoring services specifically tailored to their course syllabus. By providing students with certified tutors that they can select based on their preferences and compatibility, students are guaranteed to receive the assistance they need to succeed.

### Functionalities and Features:
* Tutor profiles, allowing for students to select tutors based on their needs, such as price and language.
* Feedback for tutors, allowing students to provide insights for the tutor's teaching style.
* Multiple options for tutoring, including video call, voice call, and chat.
* Video call recording, allowing students to revisit sessions.
*  Video call transcript summaries created by Artificial Intelligence.

### Our mission:
As students of University of Toronto, Campus Connect wants students’ questions answered successfully so they can enjoy their post-secondary experience even more. Each team member at Campus Connect has struggled during the first two years of post-secondary education. We all have made attempts to solve issues using services like **Office Hours** and **discussion boards** like Piazza, but we constantly kept encountering problems like crowded Office Hours and difficulty understanding explanations on Piazza. We've also had issues when trying to search for online resources for some convenient and quick assistance, but there have been many occurrences where we've encountered methodologies and topics that were not covered in our classes' syllabus.

**Turns out, we are not alone.** According to a **survey** we conducted with around **100** responses from post-secondary students in Ontario,
* Around **94%** who have attended Office Hours have experienced issues
* Around **90%** of students who have utilized their class’ discussion boards have experienced issues.
* Around **75%** have tried using online resources, but encountered material not taught in the current iteration of their class.

These poor experiences from students who have a hard time with what's provided at school is what motivated the team to create Campus Connect and build ULearn.

## Built With
The following are the languages, frameworks, and technologies used to build ULearn:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React
* Node.js
* WebRTC

The reason why we chose the MERN stack is because we wanted to make development time short while still being able to deliver a speedy product with the potential to scale and grow. This stack provides is key for our application as it contains components that require good performance, like chatting and changing availability for tutors. This stack is all JavaScript, so the skills developed while learning one language can easily translate to the other languages. A goal that each group member is hoping to achieve by the end of this project is to become comfortable with React as it is an incredibly powerful and popular framework. React also allows the possible implementation of cross-platform mobile support with React Native. Using a NoSQL database like MongoDB allows for great scalability and social networking capabilities. Node.js is known for its speed, and Express.js will help with simplifying the development process for Node.js. WebRTC is a feature-rich framework with all the features we need for video call, including screen sharing, recording, and more.

## Contributing
ULearn takes advantage of GitHub Flow to streamline collaboration across different machines at the same time.

### Setup:
To setup your environment to start coding, [click here](https://github.com/UofT-UTSC-CS-sandbox/final-term-project-campusconnect/blob/main/doc/sprint0/setup.md).
### Branches:
To create a branch, please follow this guideline: `category/task-name`

Here is a list of categories:
* `feature`: Implementing a new feature.
* `fix`: Fixing bugs and tweaking existing features.
* `test`: Implementing tests.
* `junk`: Experimental branch that gets discarded.

`task-name` must be an abstract and short summary of the branch's main objective. For example: `new/2FA` would be used to for developing 2 factor authentication login.

### Issues:
Issues can be reported using GitHub Issues. Please use the template provided to help developers detect and fix bugs sooner.
