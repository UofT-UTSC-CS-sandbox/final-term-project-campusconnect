## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

  

-   When: June 14, 2024
    
-   Where: Online (Discord)
    

  

### Decisions that turned out well

  

**1.  Taking on a reasonable amount of story points**: we chose to take on 31 story points as this was our first sprint and we wanted to use it to gauge our abilities to better prepare for the coming sprints. Because we took on fewer points, we were able to successfully complete everything we planned and get the foundation of our application created.
    
**2.  Peer programming**: we regularly collaborated with each other to perform code reviews. This was especially helpful for debugging other’s work and allowed us to stay informed on what everyone else was working on. If two people worked on similar tasks, they would engage in peer programming. One example of when it was used was when we were all initially learning how to write user input to MongoDB, as it is a new tool for all of us.
    
**3.  Creating well-defined roles and responsibilities**: we split our work evenly into well-defined roles and responsibilities for each team member. Each of us was responsible for a different page, and developed it entirely from the UI to the connection with the database.
    

  

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

  

#### 1.  Lack of cohesive working
    

- Connecting everything was extremely difficult since we all built our functionalities separately. This caused a massive time crunch where huge sacrifices had to be made to ensure we had a working demo.
    
-   There were also multiple instances where people’s functionalities depended on other people’s functionalities to be fully completed, causing delays in people’s work as well as a lot of time spent explaining functionalities.
    

#### 2.  Prioritizing signup and login instead of homepage
    
- Although our signup/login implemented some complex features, prioritizing it led to us falling behind as we currently have less time to implement features and functionalities that have a greater impact on the final product.
    

#### 3.  Lack of focus on documentation
    

-   The lack of documentation led to group members needing to explain their work verbally, which made some group members lose time as they had to wait for specific people to explain certain parts.
    
-   The lack of documentation also led to people who had to explain their parts lose time as they had to spend the time that could have been used to fix, document, or improve their parts on teaching and explaining their code to multiple people.
    

  
  

#### 4.  Not enough time spent on testing
    

-   Lack of testing led to the discovery of a few bugs that were discovered very late into the sprint, which further increased the stress of the already present time crunch.
    

  

### Planned changes

  

#### 1.  Teammates working on similar pages should meet before starting their pages
    

-   Since we decided to split tasks based on pages, some teammates with similar pages had completely different UI/styling, and file structure/organization.
    
-   Ex. The tutor info and personal info pages were assigned to different people, therefore the routing between pages, and the UI for each page was done differently.
    
-   Ex. The file upload and profile picture upload tasks were given to different people and so the efforts were split, even though the tasks were essentially the same
    
-   Moving forward, we have decided that those who have similar tasks and pages to work on, will meet before starting their respective tasks and finalize important decisions, such as UI, file structure, functionality, etc.
    

#### 2.  Code reviews earlier on and more frequently so that changes are merged sequentially
    

-   We decided to split the tasks and work on them individually. Due to this, we all had our individual tasks completed in our local environments, but we were lacking the flow of our pages (e.x from login to personal info page, and then from the personal info page to the tutor info page).
    
-   Moving forward, we have decided to merge our codes more frequently throughout the sprint rather than at the very end once all the tasks are 100% complete.
    

### 3.  More focus on documentation so individuals don’t have to explain their code to each teammate
    

-   Since we decided to split tasks, each individual completed their part and structured their code in a manner that best suited them. Due to this, it was difficult to understand each other’s code and code structure and we often spent many hours understanding each other’s code or meeting with that individual teammate to understand their code better
    
-   Moving forward, we have made the decision to add more comments and give focus to documentation, in order to not waste time understanding other’s code.
    

  

## Product - Review

  

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

  

#### 1.  Pages for User info (Personal and Tutor)
    

-   All users were able to add their own personal info, such as languages, university, years
    
-   Tutors were able to add info regarding the courses they wanted to teach, their hourly rate, and description
    

#### 2.  Transcript verification
    

-   Tutors were able to upload their transcript and get it verified to check if they were eligible to teach a certain course
    

#### 3.  Login + authentication
    

-   Users were able to create an account with their email, have the email verified and then proceed to login
    

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

  

All goals and tasks that were planned for this sprint were completed.

  

### Meeting Highlights

  

**1.  Prioritize UI/UX**: Based on the feedback received from the TA during our demo, going forward, a greater emphasis will be placed on the UI and UX design of our application. Our focus during this sprint was mostly on functionality, but we have learned the importance of developing a comprehensive product. In the coming sprints, we will ensure that our features are user-friendly, easy to navigate, well-designed, and provide value for the user.
    
**2.  Maintain Code Quality**: Incorporating code reviews and pair programming was greatly beneficial to our team in this sprint, so we will be utilizing them more in the future. This will help to catch bugs early on and allow us to write clean code following SOLID principles. Additionally, a greater emphasis on documentation through code comments and docstrings will benefit us and future developers.
    
**3.  Collaboration and Communication**: Foster a more collaborative environment where open communication is encouraged and work is completed cohesively and as a team, rather than individually. Based on our sprint review, we would like to encourage more collaborative working to ensure alignment and collective problem-solving, thereby enhancing productivity and innovation.
