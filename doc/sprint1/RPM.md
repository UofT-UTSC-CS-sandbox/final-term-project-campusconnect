## Meeting Details & Participants

  

The Release Planning Meeting was held on June 3, 2024, on the Discord platform. All members of the Campus Connect group attended the meeting (Arina Azmi, Anusha Karkhanis, Miri Huang, Aarushi Doshi, Michael Walker).

  
  

## Release Goal

  

The overall purpose of our project is to develop a web application called ULearn that provides university students with personalized educational assistance specific to their course syllabus. For this release, the emphasis will be on the initial process that a new user would be presented with when entering the application. The objective is to create a seamless registration procedure for the two types of users on our platform; tutors and students. Both sets of users will be able to create an account tailored to their role, upload important documents necessary to their profile creation, and log in to the application securely. In coming releases, comprehensive features to provide high-quality tutoring services to students will be incorporated into the application.

  
  

## Scope of Project

  

**Note**: all references of the form ‘SCRUM-#’ reflect the Key of the user stories in our Jira List.

  

By the end of this release, all users will be able to enter their name, university, and spoken languages, as well as upload a profile image, so that they can create an account on ULearn (SCRUM-1,3,5). The first screen a user will be presented with is one asking them to select their role; either a student or a tutor, as this affects the creation of their account (SCRUM-2). Since the tutor signup process requires additional steps, if the tutor icon is clicked on the previous screen, the user will be taken to a page allowing them to fill out extra information. They will be asked to enter the courses they would like to teach, the hourly rate they have set for their services, and any additional information they would like to share about themselves including their experiences or academic history (SCRUM-6). They will also be prompted to upload their most recent transcript, which will be verified to ensure they are qualified to provide tutoring for their selected courses* (SCRUM-4). Finally, when the signup process is complete for both sets of users, they will be able to enter their email and password to log in to the application (SCRUM-7).

  

*Criteria determined by our team for a qualified tutor was a grade of at least 80% received in a selected course.*
