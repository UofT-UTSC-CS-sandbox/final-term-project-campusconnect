 * @file Meeting.jsx
 * @desc This file contains the Meeting component, which is responsible for rendering the meeting page.
 * The component fetches the call details using the `useGetCallById` hook and displays a loading message if the user or call is still loading.
 * Once the user and call details are loaded, the component renders the StreamCall component from the @stream-io/video-react-sdk library.
 * The StreamCall component is wrapped in the StreamTheme component to provide styling.
 * If the setup is not complete, the MeetingSetup component is rendered to allow the user to configure their audio and video settings.
 * Once the setup is complete, the MeetingRoom component is rendered to display the meeting room.
